## Prompt Configuration Workflow

The extension uses a dual-prompt system for maximum flexibility:

### Default Prompt Settings
- Saved in VS Code settings as templates
- Configured once in the settings area
- Used as the basis for all reviews
- Includes default System Prompt and Review Perspective

### Prompt Information (Execution-time)
- Displayed in the main interface for each review
- Can be modified for specific reviews
- Click "📥 Load Defaults" to copy from saved settings
- Used directly when executing "🚀 Run Code Review"

This workflow allows you to maintain consistent default prompts while having the flexibility to customize prompts for specific reviews.

## Diff Configuration Options

### Context Lines
Controls how many lines of context are included around each change in the diff. Higher values provide more context but result in larger diffs.

### Exclude Deleted Files
When enabled, files that are completely deleted will be excluded from the diff analysis. This can be useful when focusing on code improvements rather than removals.

### File Extensions Filter
Specify which file types to include in the diff analysis. The filter automatically includes files from both the root directory and all subdirectories. For example:
- `cs` or `*.cs` - Include C# files from root and all subdirectories
- `razor` or `*.razor` - Include Razor files from root and all subdirectories  
- `js ts` - Include both JavaScript and TypeScript files from all locations
- `py java` - Include both Python and Java files from all locations
- `**/*.specific` - Custom git pathspec patterns are also supported
- Leave empty to include all file types

**How the Filter Works:**
The extension automatically converts simple extensions to comprehensive git pathspec patterns:
- Input: `cs` → Generates: `*.cs` (root) + `**/*.cs` (all subdirectories)
- Input: `*.py` → Generates: `*.py` (root) + `**/*.py` (all subdirectories)
- Input: `.java` → Generates: `*.java` (root) + `**/*.java` (all subdirectories)
- Input: `js ts py` → Generates patterns for all three extensions

This ensures that files matching your specified extensions are included whether they're in the project root or nested in any subdirectory structure. You can separate multiple extensions with spaces, commas, or semicolons.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No git repository found**: Ensure your workspace contains a git repository
2. **AWS credentials invalid** (Bedrock): Verify your access key and secret key are correct
3. **VS Code LM not available** (VS Code LM): Ensure you have GitHub Copilot or compatible LM provider
4. **Model not available**: Check that the selected model is available in your chosen region/provider
5. **Large diff timeout**: Consider reducing context lines or excluding deleted files
6. **Language settings not saving**: Try clearing the extension cache and reloading

### Provider-Specific Issues

**AWS Bedrock**:
- Ensure your AWS credentials have proper IAM permissions for Bedrock
- Verify the selected model is available in your region
- Check AWS service status if experiencing connection issues

**VS Code LM API**:
- Ensure GitHub Copilot subscription is active
- Check VS Code LM provider settings and authentication
- Verify the model family is supported by your LM provider

## Known Issues

- Large diffs (>100KB) may take longer to process and could timeout
- Some Bedrock models may not be available in all regions
- Network connectivity issues may cause review failures
- The extension requires proper IAM permissions for AWS Bedrock access
- Historical file content is approximated using VS Code Git API, which may not be 100% accurate for complex version histories but provides meaningful diff information for most use cases
